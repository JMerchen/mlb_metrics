"""Two deliverables from the game pick log (game_picks_backtest.assemble_game_pick_log,
see its docstring) - fit + report phase for a game-level win-probability
model, mirroring scripts/train_hitter_hit_model.py's exact structure and
scope on the team side:

1. **Significance report** (statsmodels.Logit): one univariate Logit per
   feature in game_picks.GAME_PICK_FEATURE_COLUMNS ("individually"), plus
   one multivariate Logit with all of them together ("combined"), fit on
   the full assembled log (no holdout split needed here, since statistical
   inference isn't a held-out-accuracy question). Features are standardized
   (z-scored) first so coefficient magnitudes are comparable across very
   different scales - p-values themselves are scale-invariant.

   Also tests CANDIDATE_FEATURE_COLUMNS (home_bullpen_recent_outs,
   away_bullpen_recent_outs) - real feature-search follow-up (2026-08-25):
   "what about bullpen rest/readiness." Neither is part of
   game_picks.GAME_PICK_FEATURE_COLUMNS yet; they're carried by
   game_picks_backtest.assemble_game_pick_log purely as exploratory
   columns (see pitchers.compute_bullpen_recent_workload's docstring) and
   included in this same significance report so a real p-value decides
   whether either earns a permanent place in the model.

2. **Walk-forward-validated predictive model** (sklearn LogisticRegression +
   ml_models.py's WalkForwardDateSplit machinery): the SAME no-lookahead,
   nested-holdout methodology train_hitter_hit_model.py already uses. The
   selected model is evaluated ONCE on an untouched final holdout and must
   beat BOTH a naive baseline (always predict the base home-win rate) AND
   the existing home_win_probability heuristic column (carried through the
   log unchanged, from game_picks.compute_game_win_probabilities) before
   being saved to config.GAME_PICK_WIN_PROBABILITY_MODEL_PATH.

**Scope**: this fits and reports. The saved model artifact is NOT wired
into game_picks.compute_game_win_probabilities, game_predictions.select_game_picks,
or pipeline.run() - whether/how this ever nudges live game picks is a
separate, later, backtest-calibrated decision.

Needs data/raw/statcast_<season>.parquet (see scripts/wave.py). Fully
offline - assemble_game_pick_log reads real starters/scores directly out
of persisted Statcast, no live schedule/network fetch anywhere in this
script.

Usage:
    python scripts/train_game_pick_model.py
    python scripts/train_game_pick_model.py --season 2026
