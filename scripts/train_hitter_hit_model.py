"""Two deliverables from the hitter hit log (dfs_backtest.assemble_hitter_hit_log,
see its docstring and README's "Hitter hit log" section) - real answers to
the "why is Beat the Streak survival only ~50%, and which features are
actually significant" question the earlier ad hoc analysis (n=64 resolved
picks) couldn't answer with confidence:

1. **Significance report** (statsmodels.Logit): one univariate Logit per
   feature in dfs_ml.HITTER_FEATURE_COLUMNS ("individually"), plus one
   multivariate Logit with all of them together ("combined"), fit on the
   FULL real history (~31k rows across ~120 dates as of 2026-07-28 - no
   holdout split needed here, since statistical inference isn't a
   held-out-accuracy question). Features are standardized (z-scored)
   first so coefficient magnitudes are comparable across very different
   scales (WAVE ~0-0.4 vs Total_PA ~0-30) - p-values themselves are
   scale-invariant. A feature that's constant in the current data (zero
   std) is excluded and reported as such rather than crashing on a
   divide-by-zero.

   Also tests CANDIDATE_FEATURE_COLUMNS (Days_Rest, Umpire_Factor) -
   real feature-search follow-up (2026-08-24): "use the identified
   features that we can use... test feature significance before
   committing to the model." Neither is part of
   dfs_ml.HITTER_FEATURE_COLUMNS yet; they're carried by
   dfs_backtest.assemble_hitter_hit_log purely as exploratory columns
   (see that function's docstring) and included in this same
   significance report so a real p-value decides whether either earns a
   permanent place in the model, rather than guessing.

2. **Walk-forward-validated predictive model** (ml_models.py's
   WalkForwardDateSplit machinery, the SAME no-lookahead, nested-holdout
   methodology scripts/train_dfs_ml_models.py already uses for the three
   live DFS ML signals): TWO candidate model families are grid-searched -
   sklearn LogisticRegression (config.HITTER_HIT_LOGIT_C_GRID) and
   HistGradientBoostingClassifier (config.HITTER_HIT_GBM_PARAM_GRID) -
   and whichever wins by walk-forward CV log_loss is kept, mirroring
   train_dfs_ml_models.py's own Ridge-vs-GBM selection for
   DK_Points_Hitter (quant-analytics item #2 - "model family": this used
   to be a single logistic regression with no real alternative
   considered). The winner is evaluated ONCE on an untouched final
   holdout and must beat BOTH a naive baseline (always predict the base
   hit rate) AND the existing Game_Hit_Probability heuristic column (the
   natural "heuristic to beat" here) before being saved to
   config.HITTER_HIT_PROBABILITY_MODEL_PATH.

3. **Permutation-importance report** (sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance,
   computed on the same untouched holdout, never the train pool - the
   same reasoning behind evaluating the model itself out-of-sample):
   a model-agnostic feature-importance sanity check for whichever model
   won above, chosen over SHAP specifically to avoid adding a new heavy
   dependency to a project that has never needed one beyond scikit-learn/
   statsmodels (see README's "Model family" section for the real
   comparison against SHAP).

**Scope**: this fits and reports. The saved model artifact is NOT wired
into dfs_ml.apply_ml_overrides or predictions.select_picks - whether/how
this ever feeds live Beat the Streak picks is a separate, later decision.

**PA filter**: dfs_backtest.assemble_hitter_hit_log deliberately carries
EVERY hitter with a game that date, including ones with a handful of
career plate appearances at that point - a WAVE/Game_Hit_Probability
built on a tiny sample is mostly noise, and fitting on it would let that
noise drag down real coefficients. This script filters to
Total_PA >= --min-plate-appearances (default config.BACKTEST_MIN_PLATE_APPEARANCES,
the SAME gate predictions.select_picks already applies before a hitter is
ever eligible to be a pick) right before fitting, for both the
significance report and the predictive model - the log itself stays
unfiltered so future consumers can pick their own threshold.

Needs data/raw/statcast_<season>.parquet (see scripts/wave.py).

Usage:
    python scripts/train_hitter_hit_model.py
    python scripts/train_hitter_hit_model.py --season 2026
