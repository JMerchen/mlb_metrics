"""Real go/no-go backtest for quant-analytics item #4, slice 2's same-game
diversification tie-break (predictions.select_picks's
same_game_diversification_margin - see that function's own docstring and
predictions._diversify_second_pick for the real rule this validates).

No-lookahead, reusing dfs_backtest._compute_date_outputs's per-date
recompute - the same technique scripts/backtest_selection_rule.py already
established for validating a predictions.select_picks change, and this
script deliberately mirrors that one's build_date_pools/select_and_resolve/
report shape rather than reinventing it. The one real addition: a
(date, batter) -> game_pk lookup, built once from the already-loaded raw
Statcast DataFrame (no new fetch - the same source
scripts/backtest_selection_rule.py already loads), merged onto each
date's pick_pool so predictions.select_picks can actually see which
candidates share a real game.

Restricted to the SAME final holdout date block
scripts/train_hitter_hit_model.py/scripts/backtest_selection_rule.py
already validate against (config.ML_FINAL_HOLDOUT_DATES).

Sweeps same_game_diversification_margin over a small real grid. Primary
go/no-go metric: evaluation.top_k_hit_rate(picks, k=2, require_all=True) -
the REAL "both picks must hit" Beat the Streak rule (deliberately not
just require_all=False, which backtest_selection_rule.py already reports
but which doesn't actually test what diversification is meant to
improve). Reported honestly - the real same-game pair count in this
holdout window is thin (see README's "Same-game diversification"
section for the real numbers), so an inconclusive result here is a real,
expected possible outcome, not a failure of the method.

Needs data/raw/statcast_<season>.parquet (see scripts/wave.py).

Usage:
    python scripts/backtest_same_game_diversification.py
