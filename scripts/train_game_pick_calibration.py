"""Fit + report phase for a RECALIBRATION of the existing Automated Game
Picks heuristic (game_picks.compute_game_win_probabilities), not a
from-scratch replacement model - see scripts/train_game_pick_model.py for
that (already tried, already failed to beat the heuristic: see its own
README section).

Quant-analytics follow-up ("dig into calibration", 2026-08-24): real
production data showed the heuristic's own home_win_probability ratio has
a genuine (if modest) real edge over a coin flip (accuracy 0.547, n=459
resolved picks), but its own docstring explicitly admits it's NOT a
calibrated probability - and real data confirmed a concrete problem: its
spread (std 0.035 across 93 real market-compared games) is far narrower
than the real market's own spread on the exact same games (std 0.059,
max confidence 72.7% vs the model's own 63.7% ceiling). That narrowness
was the direct mechanical cause of a real bet-advice false-edge bug
(config.KELLY_MIN_EDGE raised 0.02 -> 0.05 as an immediate stopgap - see
README's "Real quant sanity-check" section) - on any game the market is
confident about, the model's comparatively muted probability for the
other side looks like value that isn't real.

This script fits ml_models.fit_probability_calibration (isotonic or
sigmoid/Platt - both are candidates, picked via real walk-forward CV, not
guessed) on top of the EXISTING heuristic's own raw home_win_probability,
against real resolved outcomes - a rescaling, not a new model. Same real
"must clear a bar before shipping" discipline as train_game_pick_model.py:
saved to config.GAME_PICK_CALIBRATION_MODEL_PATH ONLY if the calibrated
probability beats BOTH a naive baseline AND the raw (uncalibrated)
heuristic on an untouched final holdout - reported honestly either way.

**Scope**: unlike train_game_pick_model.py's saved-but-unwired artifact,
THIS artifact IS wired live (game_picks.apply_calibration, called from
pipeline.run() and game_picks_backtest.reconstruct_historical_game_picks_from_persisted)
- loading gracefully falls back to the raw, uncalibrated heuristic when no
artifact exists yet (or hasn't cleared its own bar), same contract
dfs_ml.apply_ml_overrides already establishes for the hitter side.

Needs data/raw/statcast_<season>.parquet (see scripts/wave.py). Fully
offline - game_picks_backtest.assemble_game_pick_log reads real
starters/scores directly out of persisted Statcast, no live schedule/
network fetch anywhere in this script.

Usage:
    python scripts/train_game_pick_calibration.py
    python scripts/train_game_pick_calibration.py --season 2026
