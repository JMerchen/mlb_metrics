# mlb_metrics

Daily updated hitter/pitcher/team metrics (WAVE, PAVE, Game_Hit_Probability,
team Strength/Confidence) built from rolling windows of Statcast data, published
to `docs/` as a GitHub Pages dashboard.

## Project layout

- `src/mlb_metrics/` - the pipeline: `config.py` (window lengths and blend
  weights), `helpers.py` (event classifiers), `data.py` (Statcast fetch/raw
  persistence), `hitters.py`, `pitchers.py`, `teams.py` (metric computation),
  `pipeline.py` (orchestration + CLI), `predictions.py`/`evaluation.py`/
  `git_backtest.py` (backtesting - see below).
- `scripts/wave.py` - daily pipeline entrypoint (`python scripts/wave.py`).
- `scripts/run_backtest.py` - backtest entrypoint (`python scripts/run_backtest.py`).
- `data/raw/` - persisted raw Statcast pulls, one parquet file per season,
  committed daily alongside the output CSVs so history accumulates run over run.
- `data/predictions/predictions.csv` - append-only log of every daily pick
  (date, player, predicted probability, realized actual_hit once known).
- `docs/data/` - the published `wave.csv` / `pave.csv` / `confidence.csv`
  consumed by the `docs/` dashboard, plus `backtest_summary.csv` (see below).
  `confidence.csv` includes `Bullpen_PAVE_PLUS`
  (and `Bullpen_BAA`/`Bullpen_Power_A`/`Bullpen_HR_Per`/`Bullpen_AtBats`): PAVE
  computed only from each team's relief appearances, not its starters - a hitter
  typically sees the bullpen for 1-3 of their 3-5 at-bats in a game, so evaluating
  a matchup against "the starter's PAVE" alone ignores most of the at-bats.
- `tests/` - pytest suite covering the event classifiers, the window-blend
  formulas (WAVE, PAVE, Bullpen_PAVE, Game_Hit_Probability), and the
  backtesting pipeline, against hand-computed expected values and synthetic
  end-to-end scenarios.

## Backtesting

Every daily `scripts/wave.py` run now also logs that day's top picks to
`data/predictions/predictions.csv` (before the games happen) and resolves
any previous day's pending picks against the newly-fetched data - this is
what finally answers whether WAVE/Game_Hit_Probability actually predicts
hits, which nothing in the project did before.

`scripts/run_backtest.py` additionally replays the ~40+ days of `wave.csv`
already sitting in git history through the same pick-selection logic (see
`git_backtest.py`), so there's a backtestable dataset immediately rather than
waiting weeks for new predictions to accumulate. It resolves against
`data/raw/` and, with `--fetch-missing`, against Statcast directly for any
date not already persisted - then writes `docs/data/backtest_summary.csv`
(hit rate by pick rank, Brier score, log loss, calibration) via
`evaluation.py`. A `Backtest` GitHub Actions workflow (`workflow_dispatch`)
runs this with real network access and commits the results.

Every pick is qualified by `BACKTEST_MIN_PLATE_APPEARANCES` (config.py,
default 30) before ranking - without it, a batter with a handful of at-bats
and one lucky hit can show a probability of 1.0 and dominate the picks on
pure sample-size noise.

## Beat the Streak Tracker (dashboard)

The dashboard's top section simulates actually playing Beat the Streak,
following its real rules rather than a simplified per-day win/loss model
(see `evaluation.streak_progression()`):

- A batter is only "recommended" if `predicted_probability` clears
  `DAILY_PICK_MIN_PROBABILITY` (config.py, default 0.80) - a day can
  surface 0, 1, or up to `DAILY_PICK_MAX` (2) picks depending on how many
  clear the bar, not a fixed count regardless of matchup quality.
- A pick with an at-bat and no hit resets the streak to 0.
- A pick with zero at-bats that day (rained out, DNP, not in the lineup)
  is neutral - it neither advances nor resets the streak.
- Otherwise the streak increases by however many picks got a hit (0, 1,
  or 2).

Distinguishing "confirmed zero at-bats" from "outcome not known yet"
needed an `at_bats` field per pick (`predictions.py`) - a row only
resolves once its date falls within the coverage of the fetched/persisted
Statcast data, not just once that specific batter shows up in it.

This reads `docs/data/beat_the_streak_picks.csv` and
`beat_the_streak_summary.csv`, written by `evaluation.build_beat_the_streak_export()`
after every daily run and every backtest run - so the picks that make up the
streak are always the ones that were actually recommended *at the time*
(from `data/predictions/predictions.csv`), not recomputed with hindsight.

## Lineup awareness

Backtesting found ~30% of logged top-5 picks had zero at-bats on the day
they were picked - the batter wasn't even in the lineup. Two independent
fixes, both applied in `predictions.select_picks`:

- **Batting-order consistency** (`data.assign_batting_order`, `lineup.py`) -
  derived entirely from Statcast data already persisted, no new dependency,
  works retroactively. A batter only qualifies if their average batting-order
  slot over their current team's last `LINEUP_WINDOW_GAMES` games is in the
  top half (`LINEUP_TOP_HALF_MAX_SLOT`) *and* they've actually started at
  that rate (`LINEUP_MIN_START_RATE`) - together these exclude both a bench
  player's hot week and a recent call-up without a real track record. A
  mid-season trade resets the window to the batter's new team only.
- **Probable-pitcher matchup blending** (`schedule.py`, `matchup.py`) - a new
  dependency (`MLB-StatsAPI`, since `pybaseball` has no schedule/lineup
  support at all) fetches today's probable starters and blends each batter's
  `Game_Hit_Probability` with their opponent's probable starter's
  `PAVE_PLUS` and `Bullpen_PAVE_PLUS`, weighted by assumed at-bat share, into
  a separate `Matchup_Hit_Probability` metric - logged alongside the
  original via the existing multi-metric comparison rather than replacing
  it, since it's an unvalidated first pass that should be backtested before
  ever becoming the "recommended" metric. Also adds a "team is actually
  playing today" qualifier (an off day currently produces zero picks under
  either metric, not a stale recommendation).

Confirmed starting lineups (batting order 1-9 for *today's* game) are
explicitly out of scope for now - they post only ~2-4 hours before first
pitch, too late for the pipeline's 8am ET run regardless of data source, and
would need a second later run plus a decision about revising an
already-logged morning pick.

## Running

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/wave.py                        # today, using games through yesterday
python scripts/wave.py --as-of-date 2026-06-15 # re-run against a past date
```

`--as-of-date` only ever uses games strictly before that date, so a run can
never be computed from a game that hasn't happened yet (or is still in
progress) - this is also what lets the pipeline be re-run against any past
date once enough raw history has accumulated in `data/raw/`.

## Tests

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```
