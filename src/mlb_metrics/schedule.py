"""Today's probable starting pitchers, and (for Automated Game Picks) final
game results, via the MLB Stats API.

`pybaseball` has no schedule/lineup/probable-pitcher support at all - this
is a genuinely new data source (statsapi.mlb.com, free/unauthenticated, via
the `MLB-StatsAPI` package). Confirmed starting lineups aren't available
here - they post only ~2-4 hours before first pitch, structurally too late
for this pipeline's 8am ET run regardless of data source - only probable
pitchers, which are typically settled days in advance.

This queries the lower-level `statsapi.get("schedule", ...)` call (the raw
MLB Stats API JSON) rather than the `statsapi.schedule()` convenience
wrapper. Confirmed via a live run of `scripts/debug_statsapi.py` (the
`Debug statsapi` GitHub Actions workflow, run 29878447354): the convenience
wrapper's `home_probable_pitcher`/`away_probable_pitcher` fields are name
strings only, with no numeric ID anywhere in that response - the raw
endpoint's `teams.{home,away}.probablePitcher.id` is genuinely required to
get the same ID space as Statcast's batter/pitcher columns. The field paths
parsed below (`teams.{home,away}.team.id`, `.probablePitcher.id`) match the
live response exactly. That same live response also confirmed
`status.detailedState` and `teams.{home,away}.score` as top-level fields on
every game (no extra hydrate needed) - but only for an in-progress game, not
a completed one, so `normalize_schedule_games`'s "Final" status handling is
a reasonable extrapolation, not itself live-confirmed. Verify it the same
way (a `Debug statsapi` run against a known past date) before trusting
Automated Game Picks' resolution in production.

`normalize_schedule`'s `game_datetime` field (each game's real start time,
for the dashboard's slate-filtering feature - see dfs_optimizer.py's
module docstring) is confirmed via a live run of `scripts/debug_statsapi.py`
(the `Debug statsapi` GitHub Actions workflow, run 30661418977, 2026-07-31):
the raw game dict's `gameDate` field ("2026-07-31T18:20:00Z") is a bare,
unconditional sibling key of `gamePk`/`teams`/`status` - no extra
`hydrate` parameter needed. Still defensively `.get()` rather than
subscripted (returns `None`, never raises, if a future response ever
omits it).
