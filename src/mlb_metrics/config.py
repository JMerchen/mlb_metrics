# WAVE_WINDOWS), so a currently-hot batter dominated the ranking regardless
# of today's actual matchup - Matchup_Hit_Probability's multiplicative
# adjustment wasn't a big enough swing to overturn that. Model_Hit_Probability
# treats matchup ingredients (starter_PAVE, Bullpen_PAVE, Park_Factor,

# the lineup" - the model doesn't see lineup-order/everyday-player signals
# directly, while Approach/Matchup_Approach implicitly do via the
# avg_batting_order/start_rate qualifiers. v4 keeps Model_Hit_Probability
# as a BROAD quality gate (top HITTER_MODEL_SHORTLIST_SIZE candidates by
# model score) but hands the FINAL narrowing back to Matchup_Approach/
# Approach, so a pure hot-streak outlier the model doesn't rate can't win,
# but a legitimate lineup-order signal the model doesn't capture can still
# decide among the model's own shortlisted favorites. Also drops the

# docstring) clears this bar - on a day with no good matchups, that's zero
# picks; on a strong day, up to DAILY_PICK_MAX picks.
#
# Previously this gated on predicted_probability (Game_Hit_Probability)
# alone at 0.80 - a single-signal bar that ignored `probability` and
# `Matchup_Hit_Probability` entirely, and produced 0-pick days whenever GHP
# landed just under 0.80 even with a strong matchup (e.g. a real 0.79 GHP/
# strong-matchup day that should have surfaced a pick, didn't). Blending in
# the other two signals is the fix, but also means the same nominal
# threshold is no longer directly comparable to before - a mean of two or
# three probabilities runs lower than GHP alone whenever `probability`
# trails GHP (common - see JOINT_PROBABILITY_GATE_COLUMNS's docstring),
# so keeping 0.80 with the new blend would have been STRICTER, not looser
# (empirically: 3/42 zero-pick days at 0.80 in the backtest below, vs 1/42
# under the old GHP-only gate).
#
# 0.77 is empirically validated via a 42-day git-history replay backtest
# (git_backtest.reconstruct_historical_picks, resolved against persisted
# Statcast - Matchup_Hit_Probability is NaN throughout that replay window,
# since it's never persisted to git history, so this validates the
# GHP+probability blend specifically): the highest threshold that still
# achieves full day coverage (0/42 zero-pick days) while matching the best
# resolved hit rate/Brier score plateau seen across the whole 0.70-0.77
# range (62.5% hit rate, 0.2894 Brier, n=56 resolved picks) - thresholds
# above 0.77 both start producing zero-pick days again AND stop improving
# (sometimes worsening) hit rate/Brier on this sample. Revisit once more
# live picks accumulate carrying real (non-NaN) Matchup_Hit_Probability.
#
# That revisit already happened, informally: once live runs started
# carrying real (non-NaN) Matchup_Hit_Probability most days, the blended
# mean runs lower on an ordinary day than the NaN-heavy 42-day replay ever
# exercised - real live data hit a 5-day-straight zero-pick stretch
# (2026-08-11 through 2026-08-15) where the top-ranked candidate's real
# combined probability landed at 0.71-0.77, just under this bar every
# single day, despite real qualified candidates existing all five days.
# Rather than re-chase a moving threshold with another point estimate, this
# constant's MEANING changed instead of its value (see
# evaluation.graded_daily_picks): it's no longer "the bar a day needs to
# clear to show anything" - the dashboard now always shows its real top
# DAILY_PICK_MAX candidates, each individually graded "recommended" (still
# means "clears this exact bar") or "speculative" (doesn't, shown for
# visibility, doesn't count toward the tracked streak - see

# this gate was excluding batters who went on to hit BETTER than the

#
# Batting order isn't nothing, though - a leadoff hitter really does get

# opportunity for a hit at an identical per-AB rate. Replaced with a
# continuous signal instead of an on/off gate: lineup.compute_expected_plate_appearances

# A separate curve/projection/comparable-list per metric, not one blended
# number - e.g. power (SLG) typically peaks earlier and declines faster

# Lahman_Raw/ - not synthetic data), using only comparable data available
# at or before each test season's own year (no lookahead). Every metric
# beat the naive "always guess the sample's mean" baseline, with a real
# (not noise-level) positive correlation between projected and actual
# next-season value:
#   AVG: MAE 0.0245 vs. 0.0254 baseline, correlation 0.352 (n=355 scored)
#   OBP: MAE 0.0274 vs. 0.0284 baseline, correlation 0.429 (n=355 scored)
#   SLG: MAE 0.0533 vs. 0.0582 baseline, correlation 0.473 (n=355 scored)
#   OPS: MAE 0.0756 vs. 0.0789 baseline, correlation 0.446 (n=355 scored)
# The remaining 145/500 sampled seasons had no comparable with a resolvable
# next season and couldn't be scored (see project_next_season's docstring -
# reported, not hidden). SLG/OPS show the strongest signal; AVG/OBP beat
# the baseline only modestly, consistent with contact rate/plate discipline
# being harder to project from a same-age same-value comparable pool alone
# than power is. Re-run this backtest (and update these numbers) after any
# change to AGE_CURVE_K_NEIGHBORS/AGE_CURVE_AGE_WINDOW/AGE_CURVE_MIN_AB.

# Same methodology, pitcher metrics: 500 real sampled pitcher-seasons from
# 2010-2019 (28,127 qualified historical pitcher-seasons total, 1871-2025):
#   K9:  MAE 1.1476 vs. 1.5878 baseline, correlation 0.746 (n=296 scored)
#   BB9: MAE 0.6277 vs. 0.7776 baseline, correlation 0.616 (n=296 scored)
#   HR9: MAE 0.3312 vs. 0.3264 baseline, correlation 0.321 (n=296 scored)
#   FIP: MAE 0.5907 vs. 0.6606 baseline, correlation 0.440 (n=296 scored)
# K9/BB9/FIP all clearly beat their naive baselines. HR9 is reported
# honestly as a wash, not hidden or rounded away: its MAE is essentially
# tied with (very slightly worse than) just guessing the sample mean,
# despite a real positive correlation - year-to-year home-run rate is
# notoriously volatile (batted-ball luck, park effects, defense) even
# though it correlates with itself somewhat. Treat HR9 projections as a
# weak signal. Re-run this backtest (and update these numbers) after any

KELLY_MAX_SINGLE_BET_UNIT_CAP = 2  # hard cap, in units, on any ONE game's advised stake regardless of what Kelly computes - a deliberate user-set risk limit (2026-08-26, "the short-priced-favorite blowup risk" follow-up), not derived from data. Directly bounds Kelly's own amplification of a thin probability margin into a large stake for short-priced favorites (stake sensitivity to the sizing probability is proportional to 1 + 1/b, which is large when the net odds b are small) - a risk the CI-based pessimistic probability and kelly_fraction_multiplier can reduce but not fully eliminate on their own. Applied in game_predictions.advise_bets BEFORE the daily cap (which then still applies across whatever survives).
# Real follow-up (2026-08-26, direct response to "maybe we scaled it down
# too much... this is now taking out games where the line is genuinely
# appealing (some underdogs who have a chance)"): real production data
# (2026-08-26) showed EVERY team's real season-to-date Wilson win-rate CI
# (95% - the statsmodels/helpers.wilson_ci default) sitting at roughly an
# 8-point half-width even at 132-133 games played (nearly a full season) -
# not a fluke, just the real sqrt(n) floor of a ~130-game binomial
# proportion's precision. Combined (root-sum-square) across two teams,
# that is consistently ~11-12 points of haircut on every single game, all
# season, regardless of how much real data accumulates - larger than most
# real edges this project has ever advised on (see KELLY_MIN_EDGE's own
# history above), so it was quietly zeroing out real, honest edges,
# concretely: a real 2026-08-26 game (NYM +143, model 51.9% vs. market-
# implied 41.2%, a genuine 10.7-point edge) got fully erased by an 11.7-
# point haircut. See KELLY_MAX_SINGLE_BET_UNIT_CAP above for the other
# half of this fix - the per-bet cap is what actually bounds the specific
# short-priced-favorite risk that motivated widening this CI in the first
# place, so this constant no longer has to do that job alone.
KELLY_UNCERTAINTY_CI_ALPHA = 0.32  # ~68% CI (roughly 1 standard error) instead of the usual 95% (alpha=0.05) - a real, standard, NAMED statistical convention (not a hand-picked number), used ONLY for teams.compute_team_win_rate_ci's bet-sizing input (helpers.wilson_ci's own default alpha=0.05 is untouched everywhere else - every other real CI this project reports, e.g. win_rate_on_advised_bets_ci_low/high, beat_closing_line_rate_ci_low/high, stays a genuine 95% CI for honest reporting).

# real, liquid MLB moneyline market. The likely cause: this project's own
# model probabilities cluster much closer to 50/50 than real sportsbook
# lines do (the model is comparatively low-spread/conservative), so on
# any game the market is confident about, the model's comparatively muted
# probability for the live underdog looks like "value" that isn't real -
# it's the model under-informing itself relative to the market, not a
# market inefficiency. This project's own beat_closing_line_rate (0.357,
# n=14) is not yet statistically distinguishable from a coin flip
# (evaluation.binomial_significance p=0.42 as of 2026-08-24) - there is
# currently no proven evidence this model forecasts games better than the
# market at all. 0.05 is a stopgap that filters out most of that noise,
# NOT a fix for the underlying calibration/skill gap - see the
# "Real quant sanity-check" README section for the fuller writeup and the
# real follow-up options (raise this further, and/or gate bet-advice on
# beat_closing_line_rate actually clearing statistical significance
# before advising anything at all).
KELLY_MIN_GAMES_FOR_CONFIDENCE = 100  # a conservative, round floor for scripts/recommend_bets.py's printed confidence banner - NOT a formal power-calculation result. Below this many real n_beat_closing_line_compared games (see game_evaluation.py), the script still shows the real computed edge/stake numbers but prints an explicit "not yet statistically validated" warning rather than hiding them - real numbers, honestly labeled, not a silent gate.
UNIT_SIZE_FRACTION = 0.01  # what "1 unit" means, as a fraction of bankroll - the standard sports-betting convention (bettors report/track performance in bankroll-agnostic "units risked/won" rather than dollars, since bankroll size varies per person and shouldn't be required to compare or log a strategy's real results). 1% is a common real convention, not a formally derived number. game_predictions.csv logs bet_units = kelly_stake_fraction / UNIT_SIZE_FRACTION - a real bettor still converts units to their own real dollar stake at bet time via scripts/recommend_bets.py's own optional --bankroll flag, which this constant doesn't touch.

# Results from scripts/train_dfs_ml_models.py, run 2026-07-26 against the
# FULL real persisted 2026 Statcast history (118 hitter dates / 103
# pitcher dates - retrained after fixing a real PAVE bug: the formula
# excluded strikeouts from the at-bat denominator alongside walks/HBP,
# inflating hit-rate-against for exactly the pitchers who strike the most
# batters out (see pitchers.py's module docstring and the README's "Real
# bug fixed: PAVE excluded strikeouts" section for the full story and the
# heuristic-level before/after numbers). starter_PAVE/Bullpen_PAVE
# (hitter features) and Expected_H_Allowed (a pitcher feature, itself
# PAVE-derived) all shifted, so all three models needed retraining even
# though none of their own feature SCHEMA changed - old model artifacts
# were kept, not deleted, since the schema is unchanged, but the weights
# are new). Nested walk-forward grid search on the earlier dates only,
# evaluated ONCE on the untouched final ML_FINAL_HOLDOUT_DATES-date block.
# All three signals cleared the bar (beat both the naive baseline AND the
# existing heuristic) and are now LIVE (see dfs_ml.apply_ml_overrides) -
# reported honestly, same as every other backtest here, and this WOULD
# have said so if a model hadn't cleared the bar (see git history / README
# for that framing):
#
#   DK_Points_Hitter (HistGradientBoostingRegressor, max_depth=2,

#     MAE 4.6299 vs. naive-baseline MAE 4.6648 vs. heuristic MAE 4.7156,
#     correlation 0.161 (n=5,760) - essentially unchanged from the
#     pre-PAVE-fix retrain (0.162), as expected: this signal's heuristic
#     correlation was already near-zero for unrelated reasons (the
#     compute_matchup_adjustment ratio, not PAVE directly - see "Hitters"
#     below), so a PAVE fix alone wasn't expected to move it much.
#
#   Expected_H_Allowed (Ridge, alpha=30):
#     MAE 1.7685 vs. naive-baseline MAE 1.8395 vs. heuristic MAE 1.8032,
#     correlation 0.297 (n=481) - the PAVE fix alone already pulled the
#     heuristic from worse-than-baseline (2.6252 pre-fix, same dates) to
#     better-than-baseline (1.8032); this retrained model improves on
#     that fixed heuristic further still (1.7685), a genuine additional
#     gain on top of the formula fix, not just recovering ground the bug
#     had cost.
#
#   Expected_BB (Ridge, alpha=0.1):
#     MAE 1.0141 vs. naive-baseline MAE 1.0310 vs. heuristic MAE 1.0689,
#     correlation 0.130 (n=481) - Expected_BB doesn't consume PAVE
#     directly, so this retrain's small movement vs. the prior run
#     reflects more persisted history accumulating, not the PAVE fix
#     itself.
#
# Re-run scripts/train_dfs_ml_models.py (and update this comment) after

# Age Curves HR9 result, from scripts/train_age_curve_hr9_model.py (same
# 500-season, 2010-2019, seed-0 sample scripts/backtest_age_curve.py
# already used for the KNN number above - recomputed fresh, not assumed
# stale): HistGradientBoostingRegressor (max_depth=3, learning_rate=0.05,
# max_iter=100), trained ONLY on seasons before AGE_CURVE_HR9_TEST_YEAR_START
# (1871-2009, 16,324 rows) - MAE 0.3190 vs. naive-baseline MAE 0.3264 vs.
# KNN heuristic MAE 0.3312, correlation 0.359 vs. KNN's 0.321 (n=296/500).
# HR9 is genuinely the hardest of the four signals (single-season HR9 is
# substantially batted-ball-luck/park/defense-driven, not just a modeling
# gap - see age_curve_ml.py's module docstring) but a real multi-dimensional

# search here, contrary to the honestly-stated-up-front possibility that it
# might not. Now LIVE for HR9 only (see build_age_curves.py's
# build_projections_for_group) - every other Age Curves metric (AVG/OBP/
# SLG/OPS/K9/BB9/FIP) is untouched and still served by the original KNN
# path, which was already beating its own baseline.

# --- Ceiling/volatility signal (dfs_ceiling.py) ---
#
# GPP (tournament) DFS lineups are won by boom/spike-game players, not
# players who reliably score near their own mean - a real, well-known DFS
# strategy concept (the user's own framing: "the winner won't have
# players getting 5 points across their lineup, they're more likely to
# have lucked into players averaging 15 or so"). Ceiling_DK_Points is the
# Pth percentile of a player's own REAL historical modeled DK points
# (dfs_backtest.compute_actual_hitter_dk_points/
# compute_actual_pitcher_dk_points applied per real game date they
# played) - an ADDITIONAL informational column alongside the existing
# mean projection (DK_Points_Hitter/DK_Points_Pitcher), never replacing
# it. See dfs_ceiling.py's module docstring for why this ships
# informational-only rather than as the optimizer's default objective.
DFS_CEILING_PERCENTILE = 90

# A player with fewer than this many real scored games has too little
# history for a meaningful per-player percentile (a rookie's 3rd game
# could literally BE their whole "ceiling" sample) - falls back to the
# GROUP-WIDE (all hitters', or all pitchers', pooled) percentile at the
# same level instead, the same small-sample philosophy
# MATCHUP_LEAGUE_PAVE_FALLBACK already uses. Modest, not a
# qualified-season bar - matches DFS_PITCHER_MIN_STARTS/AGE_CURVE_MIN_IP's
# reasoning that a small-but-real sample should still surface rather than
# being silently excluded.
DFS_CEILING_MIN_GAMES = 10

# Backtested (dfs_ceiling.backtest_ceiling_signal) against the same 20
# real game dates as the heuristic DFS backtest above, no-lookahead
# (Ceiling_DK_Points computed from ONLY history strictly before each test
# date). Two questions per player type: does a higher ceiling predict a
# better real day at all (correlation), and - the more DFS-relevant
# question - of the player-days that ACTUALLY landed in that date's real
# top decile, what fraction were ALSO top-decile by Ceiling_DK_Points
# going in, vs. by the existing mean projection instead ("capture rate"):
#
#   Hitters (n=5,430): correlation 0.127. Of 543 real top-decile hitter-
#   days, ceiling-ranking flagged 19.3% of them in advance vs. the mean
#   projection's 10.1% - the mean projection is barely better than the
#   ~10% base rate (i.e. DK_Points_Hitter has almost no power to predict
#   WHICH day a hitter booms), while ranking by real historical ceiling
#   is genuinely ~2x better than that base rate. A real, honest signal for
#   hitters, not overstated - still misses 4 of 5 real boom days, but a
#   meaningfully better-than-mean-projection way to look for them.
#
#   Pitchers (n=468): correlation 0.313 (numerically higher than hitters'),
#   but on capture rate the mean projection actually did SLIGHTLY BETTER
#   (27.7% vs. ceiling's 23.4% of 47 real top-decile pitcher-days) - no
#   clear edge for ceiling over the existing mean projection on the
#   pitcher side. Small sample (n=47 boom-days) makes this noisy, but
#   reported honestly as a non-result rather than rounded into a "works
#   great" story just because hitters showed a real signal.
#
# Conclusion: Ceiling_DK_Points is a genuinely validated upside signal for
# HITTERS specifically, not for pitchers. Ships informational-only either
# way (see dfs_ceiling.py's module docstring) - the optimizer's
# `--objective ceiling` flag is opt-in, not the default, and this mixed
# result is exactly why: a user choosing ceiling for a hitter-heavy GPP
# strategy has real backing; doing the same for pitcher selection does not
# yet. Re-run this backtest (and update this comment) after any change to
# DK_Points_Hitter/DK_Points_Pitcher's own formula.

# --- Boom_Adjusted_DK_Points (dfs_ceiling.compute_boom_adjusted_score) ---
#
# Neither pure mean nor pure ceiling: the user explicitly wants a player
# with real, frequent upside swings (sometimes 20, sometimes 5, sometimes
# 0, averaging 4.8) ranked ABOVE a metronomic player averaging a flat 5 -
# credit for genuine volatility, not a max-chasing boom-or-bust score and
# not blind to the mean either. Boom_Adjusted_DK_Points =
# DK_Points_Hitter/Pitcher (today's mean projection) + k * Upside_Deviation
# (a player's own real historical UPSIDE-ONLY semi-deviation - see
# dfs_ceiling.compute_upside_deviation's docstring for exactly why it's a
# semi-deviation, not plain stdev).
#
# The grid dfs_ceiling.backtest_boom_adjusted_signal searches to pick k
# from real data rather than guessing one.

# Backtested (dfs_ceiling.backtest_boom_adjusted_signal) against the same
# 20-date sample as Ceiling_DK_Points's own backtest, same no-lookahead
# discipline, same correlation/capture-rate metrics, once per k in the

#
#   Hitters (n=5,430, 543 real top-decile days): correlation and capture

#   k=1.0: correlation 0.044, capture 12.5%; k=2.0 (grid max): correlation
#   0.061, capture 13.3%. The grid didn't localize a peak, but the
#   grid-max k=2.0 was deliberately NOT chosen: at k=2.0 the volatility
#   term (mean real Upside_Deviation 4.417) OUTWEIGHS the mean term (mean
#   real DK_Points_Hitter 5.185) by nearly 2:1, which just recreates pure
#   ceiling-chasing under a different name - directly contrary to the
#   user's explicit "neither pure boom nor pure mean" request. k=1.0 keeps
#   the two terms roughly balanced (mean contributes ~54% of a typical
#   score, deviation ~46%) while still capturing a real, validated
#   improvement over the plain mean (capture rate +24% relative, from

#   highest-scoring k in the grid.
#
#   Pitchers (n=468, 47 real top-decile days): correlation stayed flat

#   across the whole grid, with NO k reliably beating k=0.0's baseline
#   27.7% - the same conclusion Ceiling_DK_Points's own backtest reached

#   plain mean projection) is the honest choice, not a guessed nonzero
#   value chasing sample noise.

# --- Matchup_Boom_Score (dfs_ceiling.compute_matchup_boom_score, hitters only) ---
#
# Real evidence from an actual DK contest (winner spent $17,500 on
# pitchers, this project's own suggestion over $21,000, and even after
# the salary parity fix above a real slate's mean-projection lineup only
# totaled ~81 points) surfaced a deeper gap: neither Ceiling_DK_Points nor
# Boom_Adjusted_DK_Points reads TODAY's matchup on their volatility side -
# only the mean term does. This asks a genuinely different question: WHICH
# hitters are likely to boom today, given today's specific opponent, not
# just who has boomed historically.
#
# Backtested (dfs_ceiling.backtest_matchup_boom_signal, same 20-date
# no-lookahead sample, n=5,430, 689 real boom-days against an average
# no-lookahead threshold of ~14.0 points) - capture rate of those 689 real
# boom days (what fraction were flagged in advance by each signal's own
# top decile):
#
#   Mean projection (DK_Points_Hitter) alone:            10.6%
#   Matchup_Boom_Score (Boom_Rate * today's Matchup_Ratio): 14.1%
#   Boom_Rate alone (NO matchup adjustment at all):        17.3%
#
# Honest, somewhat surprising result: the matchup adjustment made it
# WORSE, not better. Boom_Rate alone beat the matchup-multiplied version
# by a real margin. Multiplying by Matchup_Ratio added noise here,
# consistent with Matchup_Ratio already being flagged elsewhere in this
# project (dfs.py's module docstring) as the single highest-risk modeling
# choice in the whole DFS feature set - already superseded by an ML model
# for the main hitter projection for exactly this reason. The same weak
# signal that dragged down DK_Points_Hitter drags down Matchup_Boom_Score
# when multiplied in.
#
# Because Boom_Rate is the real, validated win here, it's exposed as its
# own dfs_hitters.csv column (not just an internal ingredient of
# Matchup_Boom_Score) - Boom_Rate should be treated as the more trustworthy
# signal; Matchup_Boom_Score ships informational/exploratory only, not as
# an improvement over it. Reported plainly, not reframed as a win - same
# honesty standard as every other backtest in this project. Re-run this
# backtest (and update this comment) after any change to

# --- Opponent offense adjustment (pitcher_matchup.py, pitchers only) ---
#
# Unlike hitters (Matchup_Ratio/Matchup_Hit_Probability/Matchup_Boom_Score
# above), dfs.compute_pitcher_dk_points had NO opponent-quality signal
# anywhere - not even in the base mean projection - before this module.
# K9/BB9/HR9/IP_per_start are all windowed averages of the PITCHER'S OWN
# recent form; nothing scaled Expected_H_Allowed/Expected_ER by how good
# the opposing offense actually is today (a real, user-observed gap: a
# pitcher with a great price-adjusted boom profile projects the same
# whether they're facing a last-place offense or a first-place one).
#
# pitcher_matchup.compute_opponent_offense_ratio blends the opponent's
# real team_bases_pg (teams.compute_offensive_edge's pure-offense half,
# before that function's own opponent subtraction - see its docstring for
# why the already-existing offensive_edge/true_power are NOT reusable here,
# both contaminated by netting out a STALE opponent, not today's) against
# the league average, clipped to PITCHER_MATCHUP_OFFENSE_CLIP so one
# extreme-outlier offense can't blow up a projection. weight=0.0 is the
# built-in null hypothesis - it returns exactly 1.0 (today's unadjusted
# heuristic), not an approximation of it - so the grid search below always
# includes an honest no-adjustment baseline to beat, not just a range of
# nonzero guesses.

# persisted Statcast, --days 90 - pitcher sample size is much smaller than
# the hitter-side backtests above, dozens of probable starters per date vs.
# thousands of plate appearances, so this needed a longer window than the
# 20-date default used elsewhere in this project to get a reportable
# sample). n=2,081 real pitcher-days, correlation and MAE of the adjusted
# DK_Points_Pitcher against that date's REAL Actual_DK_Points_Modeled, per
# weight in PITCHER_MATCHUP_WEIGHT_GRID:
#
#   weight=0.00 (baseline, no adjustment): correlation 0.3397, MAE 6.6736
#   weight=0.25:                            correlation 0.3407, MAE 6.6658
#   weight=0.50:                            correlation 0.3414, MAE 6.6612
#   weight=0.75:                            correlation 0.3416, MAE 6.6605
#   weight=1.00 (full, unblended ratio):    correlation 0.3417, MAE 6.6600
#
# Honest result: the direction is right (correlation rises and MAE falls
# monotonically as weight increases, and the win is FULLY monotonic across
# the whole grid, unlike Matchup_Boom_Score's own backtest which went
# backwards) - but the MAGNITUDE is tiny. Weight=1.0 vs. weight=0.0 is only
# a 0.6% relative correlation improvement and a 0.2% relative MAE
# improvement, nowhere near the real margins that justified this project's
# other nonzero defaults (e.g. Boom_Adjusted_DK_Points' k=1.0 needed a 24%
# relative capture-rate improvement over k=0.0 to be chosen). At n=2,081
# this small a gap isn't distinguishable from noise with any real
# confidence. PITCHER_MATCHUP_OFFENSE_WEIGHT stays 0.0 (today's unadjusted
# heuristic) for exactly that reason - Opponent_Offense_Ratio still ships
# as an informational-only column (see docs/dfs.js's pitcher table) rather
# than being silently dropped, since the DIRECTION is real evidence a user
# may still want to see, even though the MAGNITUDE doesn't clear this

# --- Value_Score (dfs_optimizer.py, "stars not superstars" roster construction) ---
#
# Real evidence from an actual DK contest: this project's own mean/
# ceiling/boom-adjusted optimizer objectives all independently converged
# on the SAME two most expensive pitchers, spending $19,900-$21,200 on
# pitching and leaving barely enough budget for 8 undifferentiated
# floor-priced hitters. Root cause, diagnosed directly against real
# numbers: Estimated_Salary's fixed $2,000 floor is a much smaller
# fraction of an elite player's price than a replacement-level player's,
# so ANY high scorer - regardless of position - gets a structurally
# better AVERAGE dollars-per-point rate purely from that floor dilution,
# even though the earlier parity fix already equalized the MARGINAL rate.
# An objective that maximizes raw point totals under a budget will always
# rationally chase that average-rate advantage and overpay for the 1-2
# biggest scorers, leaving nothing to build a real roster (a mix of
# reliable "consistent" floor plays and genuine "boom" upside plays, in
# the user's own framing - "consistent players carry their own, boom
# players pick up slack") with what's left.
#
# Value_Score = boom-adjusted points per $1,000 of Estimated_Salary -
# directly rewards being UNDERPRICED relative to real upside (a "star")
# over being fully priced-in already (a "superstar"), instead of chasing
# raw point totals regardless of cost. Computed for BOTH hitters and
# pitchers (dfs_optimizer.build_player_pool), unlike Boom_Adjusted_DK_Points/
# Matchup_Boom_Score above, which are hitter-validated or hitter-only.
#
# DFS_VALUE_BOOM_K_PITCHER gives pitchers real boom credit for this
# specific objective - explicitly NOT the same as DFS_BOOM_ADJUSTED_K_PITCHER
# (0.0) above, which was validated against a different, narrower question
# (does boom-adjusting predict WHICH DAY a pitcher booms - it didn't).
# Implemented here anyway, per explicit user direction, because Value_Score
# answers a different question: roster-construction diversification, not
# single-day prediction. Matches hitters' own validated k=1.0 for
# consistency - not independently re-validated for pitchers via a capture-
# rate backtest (that specific metric already showed no k helps there for
# THAT question), so treat this as a deliberate strategic choice, not a
# claimed statistical win.
DFS_VALUE_BOOM_K_PITCHER = 1.0

# Value_Score maximizes a per-dollar RATIO, which carries no pressure to
# spend anywhere close to the salary cap - confirmed via a real sanity
# check against actual production data: objective=Value_Score selected a
# full legal lineup for only $39,700 of the $50,000 cap (total DK_Points
# fell from 81.38 to 56.31 vs. objective=DK_Points on the same slate),
# because leaving $10,300 unspent doesn't cost the ratio objective
# anything. That's a real flaw, not the intended "stars not superstars"
# behavior - a usable lineup has to actually spend close to its budget.
#
# DFS_VALUE_MIN_SALARY_FRACTION adds a floor constraint
# (sum(Estimated_Salary) >= fraction * DFS_SALARY_CAP) so the optimizer is
# forced to use most of the cap even under Value_Score. Chosen via the
# same real pool, testing three fractions of the $50,000 cap:
#   0.85 (min $42,500): total_salary=$43,900  DK_Points=67.99  pitcher_salary=$16,900
#   0.90 (min $45,000): total_salary=$46,000  DK_Points=73.66  pitcher_salary=$19,000
#   0.95 (min $47,500): total_salary=$47,500  DK_Points=77.79  pitcher_salary=$19,900
# 0.95 defeats the purpose (pitcher spend creeps back to the same
# overpriced $19,900 the whole feature exists to avoid). 0.85 keeps
# pitcher spend near the real winning-lineup range ($17,500-$18,100 in
# the contest that originally motivated this) while still using most of

# Rather than scrape DraftKings (fragile, likely against their ToS) or

# v1 had SEPARATE reference point ranges and SEPARATE salary ceilings per
# position (DFS_REFERENCE_MIN/MAX_POINTS_HITTER/_PITCHER,
# DFS_ESTIMATED_SALARY_CEILING_HITTER/_PITCHER, both since removed) - each
# group independently min-max-scaled to its OWN range/ceiling. This was a
# real bug found in production: pitcher DK scoring naturally spans a much
# wider raw point range (~2.6-22.75, box-score categories piling up over 6
# innings) than hitters' hit-type-driven scoring (~2.6-4.7), so
# independently rescaling each to its own ceiling made a pitcher's
# marginal DK point worth roughly 5x a hitter's in salary terms - a pure
# scaling artifact, not real relative DFS value (confirmed by inspecting a
# real optimizer output: 2 elite pitchers alone consumed ~$22K of the
# $50K cap, leaving 8 hitter slots filled with replacement-level bats).
#
# Fixed by collapsing both position groups onto ONE shared reference point
# range and ONE shared salary ceiling (estimated_salary.py's
# compute_hitter_estimated_salary/compute_pitcher_estimated_salary both
# delegate to the same constants below) - one DK point is worth the same
# dollar amount regardless of position; a pitcher still costs far more in
# practice only because pitchers genuinely PROJECT far more points, which
# is the real, not artifactual, reason.
#
# Computed from a REAL 20-game-date backtest sample (dfs_backtest.
# backtest_dfs_projections, the same no-lookahead recompute every other
# backtest in this project uses), pooling both position groups' DK_Points
# together - not a single day's snapshot like the pre-fix v1 constants
# were, and not guessed. Hitters: DK_Points_Hitter ranged 0.1595-16.6757
# (mean 4.827, n=5,430). Pitchers: DK_Points_Pitcher ranged 0.1207-25.1412
# (mean 11.459, n=468) - the pitcher range fully spans the hitter range on
# both ends here, so the shared min/max below are effectively the pitcher
# extremes; that's expected, not a bug, since pitcher DK scoring
# genuinely spans a wider range than hitter scoring even after B's
# widening. With this shared scale, a real average hitter (~4.8 points)
# now prices around $3,700 and a real average pitcher (~11.5 points)
# around $6,100 - a plausible, non-degenerate spread. Compare to the old
# per-position scaling, where every pitcher's dollar-per-point rate was
# independently ~5x cheaper than every hitter's purely from the separate
# scaling - the optimizer exploited that mispricing by loading up on
# "cheap" pitcher points, which is the actual mechanism behind the real
# 2-elite-pitchers-eat-$22K bug described above.
#
# Acceptance check against real production DK_Points (2026-07-25,
# docs/data/dfs_hitters.csv/dfs_pitchers.csv): a hitter projecting exactly
# 8.0 points priced at $6,500 under the OLD scale (pinned near the hitter
# ceiling) vs. a pitcher projecting the SAME 8.0 points at only $4,400
# (still cheap on pitchers' much wider range) - a 48% price difference for

# points, vs. a naive "always predict this whole sample's own mean"
# baseline (same go/no-go bar every other signal in this project uses:
# beat naive baseline AND a simpler heuristic by a real margin):
#
#   QB:    MAE 6.6609 vs. naive-baseline MAE 7.8183 (14.8% better), correlation 0.514 (n=6,358)
#   Skill: MAE 4.6839 vs. naive-baseline MAE 6.1814 (24.2% better), correlation 0.585 (n=50,988)

#
# QB/Skill also beat a simpler "flat, unweighted full-season-average"
# heuristic (config.NFL_QB_WINDOWS/NFL_SKILL_WINDOWS temporarily set to
# [(None, 1.0)] for the comparison run): QB correlation 0.499 vs. flat's

# (MAE 4.5122 vs. 4.6339) - real but modest margins, confirming the
# RECENCY-WEIGHTING mechanism itself (not just "having any player-form
# signal at all") adds real value, on top of already beating the naive
# baseline by a wide margin. This validates the MECHANISM (Phase 2's
# rolling-window blend genuinely predicts real outcomes better than
# guessing or a flat average) - it does NOT validate the specific
# NFL_QB_WINDOWS/NFL_SKILL_WINDOWS weight VALUES (0.20/0.30/0.50), which
# remain an unrecalibrated first-pass placeholder (see those constants'
# own docstrings) - no full grid search over weight combinations has been
# run.
#
# DST is an honest NEGATIVE result: neither the windowed blend nor the
# flat heuristic (DST flat: correlation 0.049, MAE 4.5429 - also worse
# than naive) beats simply guessing the sample mean. nfl_dst.py's
# points-allowed-bucket-via-windowed-mean approximation (see that
# module's own docstring) is the most likely culprit - DST scoring is
# dominated by the highly game-specific, high-variance points-allowed
# category, which a multi-week rolling average of a notoriously noisy
# stat doesn't predict well. DST_Points ships (the optimizer/roster need
# a DST scoring column to function structurally) but should be treated

#
# NFL_BESTBALL_SCARCITY_MIN_GAMES (a real games_played >= 8 qualifier) was
# removed after real 2025 data showed it let in players with almost no real
# offensive role - e.g. a real return specialist with games_played=11 but
# exactly 1 real offensive snap all season. games_played only requires ANY
# real stat row that week (even a single special-teams play), not a
# meaningful offensive role. Replaced by NFL_BESTBALL_SCARCITY_MIN_SNAP_SHARE
# below - see nfl_bestball.compute_position_scarcity's own docstring for the
# full reasoning. games_played/games_missed are untouched everywhere else
# (the rankings table, the injury-history proxy) - only this qualifier
# changed.
#
# The snap-share qualifier itself was originally a real PER-GAME average
# (avg_offense_pct), which was then replaced by nfl_bestball.compute_
# player_snap_share's real SEASON-TOTAL share (a player's real total
# offensive snaps that season / their team's real total offensive snaps
# that season) - the per-game average let a real one-or-two-game emergency
# spot start at a high per-game rate qualify just as easily as a real
# every-week starter (e.g. a real 2025 backup QB's real 82% single-game
# rate across exactly 1 real game); the season-total share correctly drops
# that same real player to a real 5% share once measured against the
# team's full real season offensive-play total. games_played/dk_points_total
# etc. are unaffected - only how this specific qualifier is computed
# changed.
#
# 0.3 (30% of a team's real total season offensive snaps) is a simple,
# honest first-pass default - NOT backtest-derived, and deliberately lower
# than a "majority of snaps" bar would suggest, because a real SEASON-TOTAL
# share runs meaningfully lower than a per-game rate even for genuinely
# fantasy-relevant committee/complementary players (real 2025 example:
# Jaylen Warren and TreVeyon Henderson, both clearly real, draftable RB2/
# committee-role players with 200+ real season DK points, sit at real
# season shares of 0.47/0.46 - a 0.5 bar would have wrongly excluded real,

# WORSE past 0.02, and the paired significance weakens right alongside it -
# a bigger push over-corrects, flipping real away-favorite picks to
# (wrong) home picks even as it makes the probability numbers themselves
# look marginally better-calibrated in a squared-error sense. 0.02 is the
# real, validated value - not a conservative starting guess kept out of
# caution, the backtest's own numbers say it's the best of the tested

# --- NFL Game Pick Composite: candidate reweightings (nfl_game_picks._team_composite) ---
#
# Real follow-up (2026-09-04 - "it comes down to offensive efficiency,
# defensive efficiency, and turnover ratio, for the most part"). Today's
# live NFL_GAME_PICK_COMPOSITE_WEIGHTS double-counts defensive_edge (once
# directly, once again inside true_power's own average) while never
# including offensive_edge directly at all - a real, confirmed asymmetry,
# not the user's literal intent. Two real, named candidates
# (NFL_GAME_PICK_COMPOSITE_WEIGHTS_CORE_ONLY/_CORE_HEAVY), both adding
# offensive_edge as its own direct weight for the first time, swept by
# scripts/backtest_nfl_season_carryover.py ALONGSIDE today's live weights
# as the baseline candidate - the backtest picks the winner, this file
# does not assert one ahead of that result (per the user's own explicit
# "sweep candidates, let the backtest decide" scope confirmation).
#
# Real backtest result: both candidates were CLEARLY WORSE than today's
# live weights across the full 2016-2025 replay (log_loss: live=0.6765,
# core_heavy=0.6791, core_only=0.6824 - accuracy told the same story,
# 0.608/0.594/0.573 respectively, at matched regression/prior_strength/
# home_field settings). Honest negative finding: refocusing the
# composite around offensive/defensive/turnover efficiency alone -
# dropping the record-based pyth_Strength/pyth_Confidence and
# points_per_drive signals - measurably HURTS real predictive
# performance, not just "doesn't help." Live NFL_GAME_PICK_COMPOSITE_WEIGHTS
# below is UNCHANGED; these two candidates are kept only as a real,
# backtested-and-rejected record (matching this project's "cite the real
# numbers, don't just delete the losing candidate" convention), not wired
# into any default.

# --- NFL Game Pick ML Win Probability (nfl_game_picks.apply_ml_model) ---
#
# Real follow-up (2026-09-04 - a real, concrete complaint: a "barely
# competent" rookie-QB team against "a juggernaut that eventually won the
# Super Bowl" - a game with "not a chance in hell" for the underdog -
# came out of the live model as "almost a coin flip"). Confirmed with
# real numbers, not a vague impression: `nfl_game_picks.compute_game_win_probabilities`'s
# `home_win_probability = home_rating / (home_rating + away_rating)` has
# NO free scale parameter - both ratings are z-normalized composites
# clustered around 1.0 with a real, confirmed cross-team std of only
# ~0.075 (computed live against real week-12-2025 data). Even the single
# best real team in the league hosting the single worst real team that
# week - the most extreme mismatch possible - works out to
# 1.153/(1.153+0.813) = 58.7%. The ratio formula structurally CANNOT
# express a real blowout's true confidence, no matter how much real
# historical data exists to learn from - this is a real design defect,
# not a data-availability problem, and recalibration alone can't fix it
# either (scripts/train_nfl_game_pick_calibration.py already tried
# rescaling this same compressed range and failed to beat the raw
# heuristic on a real holdout - a monotonic rescale of an already-narrow
# range has very little real signal at the extremes to learn a reliable
# steep mapping from).

# codebase on the MLB side (scripts/train_game_pick_model.py - which
# fits a real walk-forward-validated LogisticRegression/
# HistGradientBoostingClassifier directly on the same raw composite
# ingredient columns the ratio formula uses, giving it a real LEARNED
# scale a fixed ratio never has - but is explicitly left PARKED, never
# wired into MLB's own live picks). scripts/train_nfl_game_pick_model.py
# ports this exact methodology to NFL and - unlike MLB's own version -
# actually wires the validated result into live picks via
# nfl_game_picks.apply_ml_model, with a real, tested, graceful fallback
# to today's ratio+home-field heuristic if no artifact exists or nothing
# clears the real save-gate (beats both a naive baseline AND today's live
# heuristic on log_loss, on a real untouched final holdout - the most
# recent full real season, not a token few-week slice, now that 10 real
# cached seasons of train data exist).
