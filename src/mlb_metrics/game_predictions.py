"""Daily game-pick logging and outcome resolution - the game-level analog
of predictions.py. Kept as a separate module rather than extending
predictions.py: the entity (a game, keyed on game_pk) and its resolution
data source (final scores via schedule.fetch_game_results, not Statcast)
both differ enough from the batter-pick case that threading two entity
types through one module would hurt readability more than sharing code
would help.

Also owns `advise_bets` (real Kelly-edge bet-advice logic, formerly
scripts/recommend_bets.py's own private copy) - deliberately placed here
rather than in kelly.py (which stays pure scalar math, no pandas/config)
or a new module, since this IS the module that decides what goes into
each day's logged game-pick row, and bet advice is now one more real,
resolvable field on that same row (bet_units/bet_side/bet_moneyline/
bet_profit_units) - not a separate concern with its own lifecycle.
scripts/recommend_bets.py calls this same function rather than keeping
its own copy, so there's exactly one real implementation of "should a bet
be advised on this game, and how many units."

Bet sizing is tracked in UNITS, not dollars - the standard sports-betting
convention (bettors report/compare performance in bankroll-agnostic
"units risked/won" rather than dollars, since real bankroll size varies
per person - see config.UNIT_SIZE_FRACTION). `bet_units` is also the
single real signal for "was a bet advised at all": 0.0 means no bet, any
positive value is real units to risk - no separate boolean, so a numeric
column always tells the whole story on its own.

) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Pure, testable core shared by both the live daily pipeline
    (select_game_picks below) and the standalone scripts/recommend_bets.py
    report - single source of truth for "should a real bet be advised on
    this game." No network. For each logged game, derives the model's real
    probability for BOTH sides from its own logged predicted_winner/
    predicted_probability (predicted_probability is always the model's OWN
    favored side's probability, >= 0.5 by construction - the other side's
    model probability is the complement). Compares each side against the
    REAL vigged market price (market_odds.moneyline_to_implied_probability
    on the real raw moneyline) - deliberately NOT the de-vigged
    market_home_win_probability column, which exists for a different
    purpose (fairly scoring forecast skill with the book's own edge
    removed). A real bet is paid off at the real, vigged price, so Kelly's
    net-odds term has to come from that same real price too. Where
    edge >= min_edge, sizes a stake via kelly.kelly_fraction.

    Provably never recommends both sides of one game when min_edge > 0:
    edge_home + edge_away = 1 - (home_implied + away_implied) = -vig, and a
    real book's implied probabilities always sum to > 1 (see
    market_odds.devig's own test), so the two edges can never both be
    positive at once. Kept as a defensive check anyway, not silently
    trusted - if a row's real data is malformed enough that both sides
    somehow clear min_edge together, that's a real data-quality anomaly
    (e.g. a stale matching collision), not a real arbitrage in this
    pipeline's actual data - both sides are dropped for that game rather
    than either one being guessed at. Returns at most one row per
    game_pk.

    Real bet-sizing follow-up (2026-08-25 - "we need the units risked to
    not be arbitrary"): if a row carries real (non-null)
    home_win_probability_pessimistic/away_win_probability_pessimistic
    values (see game_picks.apply_kelly_uncertainty, merged in by
    select_game_picks below), that row's stake is sized off THAT real,
    per-game conservative probability instead of the raw point estimate
    scaled by `kelly_fraction_multiplier`. Gated per ROW, not just per
    column: select_game_picks always persists these two columns (so
    scripts/recommend_bets.py's later re-derivation from the log reuses
    the same real sizing), but leaves them null for any game `confidence`
    didn't cover - a caller/test that never supplies them at all
    (game_picks_backtest.py's real historical replay, older fixtures)
    is unaffected, exactly like a caller that supplies the columns but
    with null values for a specific game. `min_edge` eligibility still
    uses the raw model_probability either way - "is there a real edge
    worth considering" stays a separate question from "how much to
    actually risk given that edge."

    Also enforces config.KELLY_DAILY_UNIT_CAP (a real, user-set portfolio-
    level risk limit, not derived) - if the day's total advised stake
    fraction exceeds the cap, every advised stake for that date is scaled
    down proportionally so the day's total lands exactly at the cap,
    preserving each bet's relative size rather than favoring whichever
    game happened to be evaluated first."""

    win probability clears `min_probability` ("real separation between the
    two teams") - the dashboard still publishes the complete slate and
    highlights the flagged games, but game_evaluation.build_game_picks_export's
    real tracking is scoped to `bet_units > 0` (below), not `above_threshold` -
    a model being confident in its own favorite is a different question
    from the market actually disagreeing with it. `predicted_winner` is
    whichever side (home_team/away_team) has the higher probability;
    `predicted_probability` is that side's probability (always >= 0.5).
    `model_version` (see config.GAME_PICK_MODEL_VERSION) is stamped onto
    every row so game_evaluation.py/the dashboard can segment by which
    win-probability logic actually produced a pick - same reasoning as
    predictions.select_picks' own model_version.

    `market_probabilities` (default None - unchanged behavior for every
    existing caller/test, including game_picks_backtest.py's real calls
    that never pass one) is market_odds.fetch_market_home_win_probabilities'
    output, a real DataFrame keyed by (home_team, away_team) with a
    market_home_win_probability column - left-merged in when given, so a
    day with no market data (fetch failed, or the caller doesn't pass one)
    still logs picks normally with that column all-NaN.

    When `market_probabilities` also carries real `home_moneyline`/
    `away_moneyline` (the raw, vigged price - a defensive column check,
    not just an empty check, so any older caller/test still passing the
    original 3-column de-vigged-only frame keeps working with `bet_units`
    simply staying 0.0), calls `advise_bets` to decide whether a real bet
    is advised on each game and logs the result (`bet_units`/`bet_side`/
    `bet_team`/`bet_moneyline`/`bet_stake_fraction` - `bet_profit_units`
    stays null here, filled in only once resolve_game_predictions later
    knows the real outcome). `bet_units = bet_stake_fraction / config.UNIT_SIZE_FRACTION`
    - the standard sports-betting "units risked" convention, bankroll-
    agnostic by design (see config.UNIT_SIZE_FRACTION's own docstring).
    `bet_units` IS the real "was a bet advised" signal: 0.0 for every game
    with no real edge, a positive number of units otherwise - no separate
    boolean.

    advise_bets returns at most one row per game_pk in the normal case,
    but `market_probabilities` matches by (home_team, away_team) only (see
    market_odds.py's own doubleheader caveat) - a real doubleheader with
    two ESPN-reported events for the same two teams could in principle
    produce two advice rows for the same game_pk. Defended against
    explicitly here (not silently trusted): any game_pk appearing more
    than once in the advice is dropped from consideration entirely (with
    a warning) rather than picking one arbitrarily, so the final merge
    below is always safely one-to-one.

    `confidence` (default None - unchanged behavior for every existing
    caller/test that doesn't pass one) is teams.assemble_team_metrics'
    output, carrying each team's real win_rate_CI_Low/CI_High - when
    given, game_picks.apply_kelly_uncertainty computes a real, per-game
    conservative probability that `advise_bets` sizes stakes off instead
    of the flat `kelly_fraction_multiplier` shrinkage (see that function's
