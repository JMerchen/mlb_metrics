"""Estimated DraftKings Classic MLB fantasy points for today's hitters and
probable starting pitchers - a ranked list of good plays for
docs/dfs.html. This module itself has no notion of salary or roster slots
- that's dfs_optimizer.py's job (see its module docstring), built on top
of this module's DK_Points_Hitter/DK_Points_Pitcher output. IMPORTANT:
the optimizer's salaries are a MODELED estimate, not real DraftKings
prices - DraftKings has no public salary API - see
estimated_salary.py's module docstring before assuming otherwise.

DraftKings' scoring rules (config.DFS_DK_*) were confirmed live via web
search (not from memory) - see config.py's DFS section for sources.

## Hitters

DK pays non-linearly for hit type (a double isn't 2x a single's value:
5 != 2*3), but this project only computes a linear Expected_Bases signal
(hitters.compute_wtb) - no per-player 1B/2B/3B/HR rate breakdown exists.
DK_Points_Hitter approximates the non-linear scoring with a single
calibrated "DK points per expected total base" constant
(config.DFS_DK_POINTS_PER_TOTAL_BASE, computed from real Lahman 2015-2025
hit-type shares - see its docstring), applied to Expected_Bases after
scaling it for TODAY's specific matchup via compute_matchup_adjustment - a
ratio of Matchup_Hit_Probability (today's actual opposing pitcher,
platoon+park adjusted) to the batter's own blended Game_Hit_Probability.
That ratio is a real heuristic, not a rigorous transform: it's derived
from hit-PROBABILITY signals but applied multiplicatively to a
TOTAL-BASES signal - the two are correlated but not the same thing (a
good matchup for making contact isn't necessarily proportionally as good
for extra-base power). This was flagged as the single highest-risk
modeling choice here, and the real backtest (scripts/backtest_dfs_rankings.py)
confirmed it: essentially zero correlation (-0.004) against actual
next-game hit-type points - reported honestly at the time, not hidden.

**Update: this heuristic has since been replaced for live output.**
dfs_ml.py trains a gradient-boosting model (scripts/train_dfs_ml_models.py)
on the RAW ingredients this ratio was built from (the batter's own
WAVE/Game_Hit_Probability/Consistency/Approach, the opposing starter's and
bullpen's PAVE, Park_Factor, is_home) instead of the multiplicative ratio
itself, validated on a real held-out backtest (config.py's ML section has
the full numbers: correlation improved from -0.004 to 0.145, MAE beats
both the naive baseline and this module's own heuristic). When a
validated model artifact exists (config.DFS_HITTER_MODEL_PATH),
dfs_ml.apply_ml_overrides swaps it in for DK_Points_Hitter automatically;
compute_matchup_adjustment/compute_hitter_dk_points below are the fallback
path, used whenever no validated artifact is present - they are NOT
removed, and remain what a fresh install without a trained model serves.

**Update: BB/HBP/RBI now included too.** The original v1 excluded five of
DraftKings' nine hitter scoring categories (BB, HBP, runs, RBI, SB) - a
gap the real data made obvious once compared against real elite hitters
(a high-OBP power bat's real DK average is substantially inflated by
walks/runs/RBI, categories this model couldn't see at all, which
compressed exactly the players who should separate from replacement
level). `hitters.compute_extended_dk_rates` now adds recency-windowed
Expected_BB/Expected_HBP/Expected_RBI (same windowed-blend machinery as
Expected_Bases, reusing config.WHOPS_WTB_WINDOWS - see that function's
docstring), each scored at its own DK point value
(config.DFS_DK_HITTER_BB_POINTS/HBP_POINTS/RBI_POINTS) and added directly
to DK_Points_Hitter - NOT run through compute_matchup_adjustment's ratio,
which was already flagged as this module's highest-risk choice and
confirmed not to hold up; compounding it onto three more categories would
just spread that same risk further. `DK_Points_Hitter_HitType` keeps the
old hit-only subtotal alongside the new combined total, for continuity
with the original backtest numbers.

Expected_RBI is itself an approximation (helpers.estimate_rbi: a
completed plate appearance's own bat_score/post_bat_score delta) with two
known, accepted limitations - see that function's docstring (can miss a
run scored on an earlier pitch of the same PA; can't distinguish a
legitimate RBI from an error-scored or GIDP-third-out run, neither of
which is a real RBI).

**Still explicitly excluded from v1**: runs scored (crediting the RUN to
the batter who eventually scored needs tracking a specific runner across
multiple subsequent plate appearances within the same game/inning via
on_1b/on_2b/on_3b - real engineering work with real edge-case risk from
wild pitches/passed balls/caught-stealing/errors moving runners in ways
not obviously visible in this project's row-per-pitch data shape,
deferred as a documented v1.1 follow-up, not silently dropped) and stolen
bases (Statcast's `events` column has no structured stolen-base event
type at all - steals only appear in the free-text `des` description
field, e.g. "Jeremy Peña steals (1) 2nd base", attributed to whoever was
AT BAT during the steal, not the runner - crediting the correct player
would require parsing a name out of free text and matching it back to a
player id, a real departure from this project's established numeric-ID-
join convention (schedule.py's/roster_positions.py's explicit rationale
for avoiding name-matching) - explicitly NOT planned, not just deferred).

## Pitchers

Needs one new signal this project didn't have: pitcher_form.py's
recency-windowed K9/BB9/HR9/IP-per-start (mirroring pitchers.compute_pave's
windowing pattern applied to different underlying stats). DK_Points_Pitcher
combines:
- Expected_IP (= pitcher_form's blended IP_per_start) at
  config.DFS_DK_PITCHER_IP_POINTS/inning.
- Expected_K = K9 * Expected_IP / 9, at config.DFS_DK_PITCHER_K_POINTS/K.
- Expected_BB = BB9 * Expected_IP / 9, at config.DFS_DK_PITCHER_BB_POINTS/BB.
- Expected_H_Allowed = PAVE (pitchers.compute_pave's AB-level hit rate,
  already computed for the live pipeline) * an estimated batters-faced
  count (Expected_IP * config.DFS_BATTERS_FACED_PER_INNING, computed from
  this project's own persisted Statcast - see that constant's docstring),
  at config.DFS_DK_PITCHER_H_POINTS/hit.
- Expected_ER, estimated via FIP rather than a real earned-run signal -
  this project has a consistent, repeated house principle against
  modeling ERA/earned runs directly (defense/sequencing-dependent, not
  just the pitcher's own stuff - the same reasoning pitchers.py's
  Power_A_PLUS and age_curve.py's pitcher metrics both already use FIP
  over ERA for). FIP_Windowed is computed from K9/BB9/HR9 the same
  formula age_curve.py/traditional_stats.py use from raw counts (the
  count-based and rate-based forms are algebraically identical - IP
  cancels out), reusing config.FIP_CONSTANT. Expected_ER =
  FIP_Windowed * Expected_IP / 9, clipped at 0 (a small-sample-windowed
  FIP can go slightly negative before the additive constant fully
  corrects it). Deliberately excludes HBP allowed (pitcher_form.py
  doesn't track it - a documented simplification, consistent with
  age_curve.py's own pitcher FIP already being HBP-inclusive only where
  Lahman happens to carry it).

**Explicitly excluded from v1**: Win (needs a win-probability estimate -
too dependent on the pitcher's own team's offense that day to reasonably
approximate), and the rare discrete bonuses (complete game, complete game
shutout, no-hitter). Relief pitchers are entirely out of scope - IP per
appearance is only a meaningful "per start" number for a starter, not a
bullpen arm's variable-length outing.

**Update: Expected_H_Allowed and Expected_BB have since been replaced for
live output.** The original backtest found Expected_H_Allowed's MAE was
actually WORSE than the naive baseline (a likely systematic scaling bias
in the PAVE * batters-faced calculation above) and Expected_BB only weakly
correlated. scripts/train_dfs_ml_models.py trains a Ridge regression on
the SAME inputs (K9/BB9/HR9/IP_per_start/Expected_IP/Expected_K/
Expected_H_Allowed/FIP_Windowed) for each component separately, validated
on a real held-out backtest - both now beat their naive baseline AND this
module's own heuristic (config.py's ML section has the full numbers).
dfs_ml.apply_ml_overrides swaps in either/both wherever a validated
artifact exists (config.DFS_PITCHER_H_ALLOWED_MODEL_PATH/
DFS_PITCHER_BB_MODEL_PATH), recomputing DK_Points_Pitcher from whichever
components were actually used; compute_pitcher_dk_points below remains the
fallback path when no validated artifact is present.

## Qualifiers

Hitters need config.BACKTEST_MIN_PLATE_APPEARANCES (the same guard
predictions.select_picks uses) and a game today. Pitchers need
config.DFS_PITCHER_MIN_STARTS recorded starts (a 1-2 start sample makes
HR9 especially pure noise) and to be a team's announced probable starter
today - no neutral fallback for an unannounced pitcher, unlike
matchup.py's hitter-side blends, since there's no reasonable "neutral
pitcher" to rank.
