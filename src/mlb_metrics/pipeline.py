"""End-to-end pipeline: fetch Statcast -> persist raw -> compute hitter,
pitcher, and team metrics -> write docs/data/*.csv.

This replaces the original monolithic scripts/wave.py; that file is now a
thin entrypoint that calls `main()` here.

`run()` takes an explicit `as_of_date` and only ever uses games strictly
before it, rather than implicitly relying on the pipeline being run early
enough in the day that Statcast doesn't have today's games yet. That makes
the same-day leakage cutoff explicit and testable, and - together with raw
data persistence - lets this function be re-run against any past date for
backtesting (Phase B).
