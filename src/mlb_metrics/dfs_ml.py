"""ML-based replacements for dfs.py's three weak-signal projections
(real backtest numbers, config.py's DFS section):
  DK_Points_Hitter:    correlation -0.004 (essentially zero)
  Expected_H_Allowed:  MAE worse than the naive baseline
  Expected_BB:         weak correlation (0.182)

Walk-forward, grid-searched (ml_models.py) Ridge/gradient-boosting models,
trained on dfs_backtest.assemble_ml_training_rows's full-history feature
table - the SAME no-lookahead discipline (each row's features come only
from data strictly before that row's game date) the existing heuristic
backtest already uses.

## Hitter features: raw ingredients, not the flagged-bad ratio

dfs.compute_matchup_adjustment's ratio (Matchup_Hit_Probability / a
batter's own Game_Hit_Probability, applied multiplicatively to
Expected_Bases) was flagged in dfs.py's own docstring as the single
highest-risk modeling choice in that module, and the real backtest
confirmed it: essentially zero correlation. build_hitter_features exposes
the RAW ingredients that ratio was built from (the batter's own form, plus
matchup.py's own internal log5-blend inputs - the opposing starter's PAVE,
their bullpen's PAVE, the venue's Park_Factor, is_home) instead of only
the already-blended Matchup_Hit_Probability, so a model can learn its own
(possibly additive, possibly nonlinear) combination rather than
inheriting the multiplicative assumption. Also includes Expected_BB/
Expected_HBP/Expected_RBI (hitters.compute_extended_dk_rates) now that
dfs.compute_hitter_dk_points scores those categories too - the SAME
raw-ingredients philosophy applies: these are fed directly, not run
through the flagged ratio.

**Retraining note**: HITTER_FEATURE_COLUMNS widened when BB/HBP/RBI
scoring shipped, again to add real Statcast batted-ball-quality signals
(Exit_Velo/Barrel_Rate/xBA/xwOBA, hitters.compute_quality_of_contact),
again to add pitch-type-family signals (Fastball_WAVE/Breaking_WAVE/
Offspeed_WAVE - hitters.compute_pitch_family_rates - and today's probable
starter's own starter_fastball_rate/starter_breaking_rate/
starter_offspeed_rate - pitchers.compute_pitch_arsenal), and again to add
real per-pitch plate-discipline signals (Whiff_Rate/Chase_Rate -
hitters.compute_plate_discipline) - any model artifact trained on an
OLDER (narrower) schema is schema-incompatible and MUST be retired
(deleted, not left in place) whenever this list changes, since BOTH
apply_ml_overrides's predict() call AND
predict_hitter_hit_probability's predict_proba() call are NOT wrapped in
a try/except - a stale artifact would hard-crash
scripts/build_dfs_rankings.py/live daily picks rather than gracefully
falling back. Every prior modeling attempt in this project used only
outcome-RATE signals (WAVE/PAVE-style hit/walk/RBI rates) - never a real
measure of contact QUALITY (how hard/well the ball was actually hit,
independent of whether that particular ball found a fielder), never a
pitch-type-specific matchup signal (does this batter's own fastball/
breaking/offspeed split suggest a better/worse day against THIS starter's
own real pitch mix), and never a real per-pitch plate-discipline signal
(how often the batter swings and misses entirely, or chases a pitch
genuinely outside the strike zone) - even though the raw Statcast columns
needed for all three (launch_speed/launch_angle/
estimated_ba_using_speedangle/estimated_woba_using_speedangle/
launch_speed_angle for the first, pitch_type for the second, description/
zone for the third) were sitting unused in the already-persisted raw data
the whole time.

## Pitcher features: dfs.py's own engineered columns

Unlike hitters, dfs.compute_pitcher_dk_points's engineered columns
(K9/BB9/HR9/IP_per_start/Expected_IP/Expected_K/Expected_H_Allowed/
FIP_Windowed) aren't suspected of a bad transform the way the hitter
ratio was - Expected_H_Allowed's problem (real backtest: MAE worse than
baseline despite positive correlation) looks like a systematic scaling
bias (PAVE * Expected_IP * DFS_BATTERS_FACED_PER_INNING), the kind of
thing a regression CAN absorb from the same inputs. So pitcher features
reuse dfs.py's already-engineered columns directly (this also keeps
train-time and live-serving feature assembly identical by construction,
since both call dfs.compute_pitcher_dk_points).

## Fallback discipline

apply_ml_overrides only overrides a signal when a trained model artifact
exists (ml_models.load_model returns non-None) - a missing/corrupt/
not-yet-trained artifact silently keeps the existing heuristic column
untouched, the same "missing optional input degrades to a documented
fallback, never a crash" pattern pipeline.run() already uses for a failed
schedule fetch. Each signal is independently gated - a hitter model
failure never affects the pitcher columns and vice versa.
